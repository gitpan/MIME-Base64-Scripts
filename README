This package contains a few scripts that used to live in the
MIME-Base64 package but was not assimilated as part of the perl-5.8
core.

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version
5.005 or better.  For perl version 5.005 and 5.6 you will also need to
install the MIME-Base64 package from CPAN.  For perl 5.8 and later it
is already included.

Installation as usual:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make install
